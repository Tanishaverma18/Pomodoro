# Pomodoro Timer ⏳
This project is a **Pomodoro Timer** built using the **Python Tkinter library**. The Pomodoro Technique helps improve productivity by alternating focused work sessions with short breaks. The timer follows the standard intervals of 25 minutes of work, followed by 5-minute breaks, and includes a longer break after four sessions.

## Features 😊
- Configurable work and break intervals<br>
- Keeps track of completed Pomodoro sessions<br>

## How It Works💻
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals:
- **Work session**: 25 minutes
- **Short break**: 5 minutes
- **Long break**: 20 minutes after four sessions
  
The GUI provides buttons to:
- Start/Reset the timer.
- Display the "✔" after completed each session.
